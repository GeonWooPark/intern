FORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasOverview July 24, 2019Mary TetlowFORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasForward:Our Story, Our AmbitionWe have a tribe.Our tribe comprises a global group of RPA adopters, evangelists, explorers, prospectors, and intrepids across the spectrum. It includes those who are inspired by the promise and practice of automation first?and those who seek that inspiration. Those who have achieved amazing things using UiPath technology?and those still searching for a pathway.FORWARD gathers our tribe together each year, allowing us to deepen connections, strengthen purpose, explore and learn, and draw audacious inspiration from each other.Like Cannes or Sundance in entertainment, or Davos in world affairs and industry, FORWARD serves as a center of gravity in the RPA world ? a widely anticipated annual event supporting and celebrating the visionaries and groundbreakers who are moving the 4th Industrial Revolution forward. It¡¯s where we acknowledge the most fulfilling journeys and the most profound triumphs in the RPA universe, and unveil the most important new discoveries, inventions, trends, and news. It¡¯s a safe space to ask questions, gain knowledge, and perceive new possibilities.Of importance, FORWARD is not about UiPath. It¡¯s about what UiPath enables our tribe to do. It¡¯s how we make people impatient to forge their path to the future, using our technology to change work in meaningful, inspiring, and surprising ways. It¡¯s about how we enable them to Reboot Work.FORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasDraft Schedule & AgendaThe AudienceCOMMS PLANThe VenueFORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasFULL FORWARD AREAAn overview of themain activity areas.TOWER BALLROOM MAIN STAGEGENERAL SESSIONSGRAND BALLROOM SEATED LUNCH EVENING PARTY HOSTED ROUND TABLESBELLAGIO BALLROOM EXPERTSVILLE THE CUBE & VISION STAGESMALL BREAKOUT AREA MEETING ROOMSDONATELLO ROUND TABLE WORKSHOP SET-UPMONET + PATIO RECHARGERAPHAEL BREAKOUTDA VINCI BREAKOUTOUTDOOR GARDENAND POOL AREARegistration DeskRegistration DeskFORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasGENERAL SESSIONFORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasGENERAL SESSIONFORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasEXPERTSVILLE (BELLAGIO)Heat map showing the Partners, UiPath areas etc.5 UiPath Towers (20 Stations)40 Partner Booths20 Partner Digital SponsorshipsVision Stage (100 cap.)FORWARD III | October 15th - 16th | Bellagio | Las VegasEXPERT VILLAGE STAGEOn stage (Vision Talks): 2 screens, single source16:9 Ratio.
